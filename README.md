Project name
GAEB4Linux

Goal
GAEB XML is a standard for data exchange that is used in the German construction industry. The GAEB (Gemeinsame Ausschuss Elektronik
im Bauwesen) is responsible for its maintenance and further development.
Working with GAEB files is essential in the German construction industry. There is a wide range of tools for this, practically all
software that works with commercial data in the construction industry uses the GAEB standard. The standard includes service
specifications, prices, quantity takeoffs, invoices and even detailed calculation and measurement data. Unfortunately, almost all
available IT programs are proprietary. There are virtually no open source tools, especially for Linux.
This project aims to make GAEB software available as open source for Linux.

Planned range of functions

GAEB Viewer
Step 1 is a simple GAEB viewer with which GAEB files for service specifications (X81-X87) can be opened and displayed. It should be
possible to import and export from/to all formats. Prices, text additions and other bidder details can be entered and saved/exported.
The viewer should offer options to show/hide the XML tags. Export should also be possible as pdf file with the possibility to generate
a complete offer as pdf (text header/text footer).
Tender specifications
In the next step, it should be possible to create your own service specifications. Enter texts or take them from templates. The
connection to the interface of the standard service book or alternative functionality for text generation.
At this stage at the latest, project management would also be useful with management of extended data that goes beyond the gaeb data set. database connection.
Functions for managing and sending requests or offers.
